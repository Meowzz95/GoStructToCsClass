# GoStructToCsClass
Use this when you are writting a .net core application that needs a model from Go project.

Simply copy your go struct in `input.txt`, run `main.py`, you will get .net core class with `JsonProperty` set.

# This is a not a production ready project
I just use it for my own convenience, however you can benifit from it if you are in similar situlation :)
